# Sonifying & visualising sea wave datasets

A python script was used for the initial oceanographic wave data processing (timeseries, txt file)
python-osc lib was used to send the data in real time from python to SuperCollider and from there to openFrameworks

Sonification: Each value configures the frequency, amplitute, pan, modulation frequency and more synth parameters.
Visualisation: Each column (temp, Significant height [Ht], Zero crossing wave period [Tz], Max height [Hmax]) configures multiple parameters
