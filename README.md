Sea wave data (timeseries, txt file) are being iterated using Python. 
In real time each value is being sent to SuperCollider and from there to 
OpenFrameworks as an OSC message.  
  
Audio: Each value controls the frequency, amplitute, pan, modulation frequency and more Synth parameters.  
Visuals: Each seawave column (temp, significant height [Ht], Zero up-crossing wave period [Tz], Max height [Hmax] controls multiple parameters)
